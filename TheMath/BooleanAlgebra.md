# Basic Boolean algebra logic

Operates on data represented in a Binary state - hence 'Boolean' algebra.

<br/>
<br/>

<b>X ^ Y</b>
X | Y | Returns
---|---|---
0 | 0 | 1

<br/>
<br/>

<b>X V Y</b>
X | Y | Returns
---|---|---


<br/>
<br/>

<b>NOT X</b>
X | Returns
--- | ---
1 | 0


<br/>
<br/>

Once basic operations are defined we can combine them similar to how mathimatical operations are applied.


```
f(x,y,z) = (x AND y) OR (NOT(X) AND  z)
```


<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, there are common laws as with standard mathimatics.

<b>Cummulative Law</b>

<b>Associative Law</b>

<b>Distributive Law</b>

<b>De Morgans Law</b>
