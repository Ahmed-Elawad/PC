Hardware virtualization is about technologies that enable hardware components to be made available independently of their physical basis using hypervisor software. The best-known example of this is the virtual machine (VM). A VM is a virtual computer that behaves like a physical computer, including hardware and operating system. Virtual machines run as virtual guest systems on one or more physical systems referred to as hosts.

It will blend in most enterprise environments so that we will appear physically and virtually less suspicious. It is easier to navigate and communicate with other hosts on an Active Directory domain if we use Windows versus Linux and some Python tooling. Traversing SMB and utilizing shares is much easier this way. With this in mind, it can be beneficial to familiarize ourselves with Windows and set a standard that ensures we have a stable and effective platform to perform our actions.
