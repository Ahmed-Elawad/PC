# Physical Behaviour of the system

Combinatorial logc vs sequential logic

# fetch execute cycle

The fetch execute cycle or loop fetches an instruction, then executes it, and uses the output to repeat the cycle.


### Fetch

The program counter defines the location of the next instruction to execute. To jump through the program we manipulate the program counter.

The output of the program counter is fed into the address input of the program memory. The program memory then outputs the next instruction to be executed.

### Execute
