# Memory implementation using hardware and circuits

Various memory units interface to provide a personal computer.

<br/>

## Main Memory

Memory that resides in the computer and is hardwired into the motherboard. Consists of different categories of memories like RAM...

<br/>

## Secondary Memory

Memory that is attached to extend the computer

<br/>

## Volitile/Non volitile memory

Volitile memory is not persisted between the on off states of the computer. Once a current is removed certian memory is erased(Ram) while non volitile is persisted(ssd or hdd).

```
RAM:
    Used to store the data and instructions for the program.
```

<br/>

## Persepctive

There is a physical and logical perspective. The implementation of this pc is all logical, however the concept of a gate can be considered a the physical layer of the PC.

<br/>

## Registers

A register is a combination of bits.hdl which retain memory. Linking bits in a bus(16, 8, 4) constructs a register of that size.

Register width = W: 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit

Register State:
 logically it's the value physically it's the state
