# Project Description

This is a project following the course 'Nand2Tetris' to work through the various levels of abstraction provided in digital devices. The course covers:

- [ ] Gate Logic
- [ ] Memory
- [ ] Programming languages

The project does not cover:

- [ ] Physical implementation of chips
- [ ] Electrical engineering concepts

The 'Gates' directory can be a representation of the physical wiring of the logic gates since it's constructed in HDL. Software Engineering is primarely theoretical so the focus here is to develop an understanding the physical implementation and abstractions that may effect a Software.

Software is a modification of the tools behaviour. My intent is to:

- [ ] Understand the tool that we use every day
    ```
    Todays digital devices are an itteration of abstracting solutions. 
    I would like to have a better idea of where we might be headed or 
    how I can support in using the tool effectively.
    ```
- [ ] Become a better engineer
    ```
    The layers of abstraction provide a solution or interface to control 
    the behaviour of the preceding layer. I hope to learn more about why 
    these layers were provided and how that can be applied to support 
    making better[the right] decisions in the future.
    ```
- [ ] Build a platform
    ```
    I would like to investigate how various programs run and the ways 
    they solve problems - or better yet what those 'problems' are. 
    Hoping to itterate on this implementation and work with hardware 
    and software for personal interest. Again - how did people decide 
    to make the tool do what it does.
